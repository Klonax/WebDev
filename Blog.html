    <div class="Columns">Entry 1:During this entry i am still yet to complete the site 
        report page. I have learnt recently linking pages and each page use a consistent foundation with the only difference being the style sheet 
        link been changed to match accordingly to the relevant html document. 
        Entry 2: During this entry i managed to figure out the uses of columns and have used it on two occasions, one being the use of columns 
        to hold placeholder images and help organize the page. The other use is actually for the blog page and 
        can be seen with the separation marks. Entry 3: I have now learnt the following HTML categories - 
        Elements, Attributes, Event Attributes and url encoding. As for CSS i learnt the following - 
        CSS functions, Properties, animatable and units/colors.    </div>
