    <div class="PnNBox">Positives -- During the course of this development i found it relatively
         easy to build multiple pages once the first one had been successfully built. This is due
          to the relative ease within changing css links providing html foundations so that all
           the web pages are interlinked. Both languages were easy to understand after a couple 
           implementations and allowed me to progress quickly each time giving the pages more 
        detail as i went along. Negatives: The concepts of positioning i struggled with the most
        especially with there been 3 values to choose from (%,px,pc) this made it time consuming
        for me when placing elements on the screen. As a result i ended up making the website and
         the mobile version at completely different development stages.  </div>
    <div class="MEBox"> As a whole this module has taught me a lot of the basic web dev skills i 
        did not have before as i only had a basic understanding of the concept of HTML and CSS.
        It has also shown me a potential career path that i may want to follow front-end web
         development at the end of the course. I am now going to be introduced to javascript 
        and will see how i can apply it accordingly with the other two languages. This has been 
        a relatively easy language to understand but my CSS knowledge can still improve a lot more.
        The way the module was presented in detailed batches allows you study and learn the elements
        well to the point that when it comes to implementations the coder will hardly struggle. </div>
    <div class="DTBox">April 15th : At first the website required a consistent foundation so that 
        it's easier for users to navigate and understand the elements displayed. It also made for a 
        better presentation which allows the website to look more professional. April 16th: I 
        introduced a lot of new concepts here. The use of Links was implemented into each page so
        that instead of opening a new tab and having the tab act as a page with extra buttons
        to return to the previous page, pages were nested into one navigation bar which remains
        consistent across all the pages. I chose a color pallette of 4 colors and have used all 
        of them at different stages. The Body background need to contrast the nav bar. This influenced 
        the nav bar background to be light in color and the main background to dark so users can quickly 
        find the Nav Bar. The font i kept white across all the pages as it allows a clear contrast 
        between the dark colors used in the background. The Nav bar was influenced heavily by the 
        w3schools Nav bar and has th same concept except the use of links than actual buttons. 
        Another concept i used was columns as they allowed me to split paragraphs with markers and 
        i reused them when it came to the portfolio page as the placeholder images needed splitting 
        up.The Fonts and general positioning of elements took the same style with just the values changing
        as  i didn't want to lose the consistency that had been built. As a result i only used 2 font packs <div>
