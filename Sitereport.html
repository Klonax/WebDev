    <div class="PnNBox">Positives -- During the course of this development i found it relatively
         easy to build multiple pages once the first one had been succesfully built. This is due
          to the relative ease within changing css links providing html foundations so that all
           the web pages are interlinked. Both languages were easy to understand after a couple 
           implementations and allowed me to progress quickly each time giving the pages more 
        detail as i went along. Negatives: The concepts of positioning i struggled with the most
        especially with there been 3 values to choose from (%,px,pc) this made it time consuming
        for me when placing elements on the screen. As a result i ended up making the website and
         the mobile version at completely different development stages.  </div>
